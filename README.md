Scala Tutorial â€“ 7
1. Write a Scala function called filterEvenNumbers that takes a list of integers as input and uses a
lambda function to filter out the even numbers from the list. The function should return a new
list containing only the even numbers.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
You can use the filter method on lists to implement the filterEvenNumbers function with a
lambda function inside it.
2. Write a Scala function called calculateSquare that takes a list of integers as input and uses a
lambda function to calculate the square of each number in the list. The function should return a
new list containing the squares of the input numbers in the same order.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
You can use the map method on lists to implement the calculateSquare function with a lambda
function inside it.
3. Write a Scala function called filterPrime that takes a list of integers as input and uses a lambda
function to filter out the prime numbers from the list. The function should return a new list
containing only the prime numbers.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
